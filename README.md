# **Bike Sharing Usage Prediction Network**

*An Introductory Neural Network*

## Purpose

This was the very first neural network created in my Udacity Deep Learning course. The stated purpose of the project was:

*"In this project, you'll build your first neural network and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership. We've provided some of the code, but left the implementation of the neural network up to you (for the most part). After you've submitted this project, feel free to explore the data and the model more."*

## Implementation

Jupyter Notebook with python 3.6. 

Pertinent Files:

  - The original, completed notebook from the course. 
  - A more readable version of this completed notebook is here as "Predicting_bike_sharing_data.md" 
- my_answers.py
  - The completion of this file was the submitted purpose of this project.

## Description

The details purpose of this lesson was to:

1. Follow through the coding of a neural network
2. Code the sigmoid function to be used as the activation function
3. Code the forward propagation function
4. Code the backward propagation function 
5. Code a single iteration of a training pass on the network
6. Determine optimal hyperparameters.

The entire network is coded in numpy arrays without the use of any packages such as pytorch or tensors. Thus the operation of the network is can be followed without needing to know any additional packages.
